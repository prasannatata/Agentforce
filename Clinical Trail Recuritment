Data Modeling (Custom Objects):

Candidate Profile – Stores patient demographics, health traits, etc.

Trial Protocol – Defines the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Screening Log – Captures each screening attempt.

Referral Record – Tracks referral status and outcome.

Eligibility_Criterion__c - To store individual inclusion/exclusion rules for each Trial_Protocol__c

Example Real-World Use Case: each protocol has its own set of eligibility rules stored as records. The system loops through and evaluates each one against the candidate profile.
Protocol A has 3 inclusion rules and 2 exclusion rules. Candidate X qualifies on 3 inclusion checks but fails 1 exclusion rule → system logs that failure, marks them ineligible, and doesn’t show the trial in results.

Outreach_Event__c Object (for Logging Outreach Activity)
For outreach, I’ve added a lightweight Outreach_Event__c object to log all digital outreach attempts and responses. On the agent side, we can start the conversation with a simple prompt asking if the user wants to check trial eligibility. Once they respond, the flow collects info and runs the screening logic. This mimics a real outreach-to-screening funnel, just like in a real-world clinical recruitment system.”



Matching Funnel (Flow Logic):

Step 1: Get Candidate info using the provided ID.

Step 2: Match to available Trial Protocols using eligibility logic.

Step 3: Filter based on location or site availability (e.g., enrolling sites).

Step 4: Log screening attempt and reason for success/failure.

Step 5: If successful, auto-create Referral Record and send notification.



Scope Area	How Your Flow Covers It


Outreach	Not in Flow yet, but this would come from marketing/agent front.
Pre-Screening	✅ Flow dynamically checks candidate eligibility using inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Trial Matching	✅ Flow loops through eligible Trial Protocols and matches based on age, gender, diagnosis, etc.
Scheduling and Referral	✅ If matched, flow auto-creates a Referral Record linking the candidate to the appropriate site or coordinator.
