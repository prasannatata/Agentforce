Thanks for sharing the screenshots of your **Agentforce PoC: Clinical Trial Recruitment** document. Based on that, here’s an enhanced message for Todd that clearly ties your updates and requests to the documented scope and objectives:

**Hi Todd,**

Would it be okay to reschedule our meeting to tomorrow? I’m finalizing a few updates and want to ensure I present more meaningful progress aligned with the PoC goals.

Since our last discussion, I’ve completed:

* The **“Find Trials Near Me”** feature based on location.
* Added options for candidates to **update info, withdraw, or check referral status**.
* Refined **pre-screening logic** to align with real-world criteria like medication use and trial history.
* Enhanced **eligibility rule checks** mapped to dynamic trial protocols.

Currently working on:

* A proper **email OTP verification step** before showing referral/trial info.
* Handling **partial user input** more gracefully with guided prompts.

Also exploring:

* A **scoring-based eligibility model** to support nuanced recommendations rather than strict pass/fail.
* Logic to **auto-recommend alternate trials** nearby when a candidate doesn’t qualify for the primary match—this ties back to the Trial Matching and Scheduling goals in the PoC document.

Rescheduling would give me time to cleanly integrate these enhancements and demonstrate a more complete, real-world-ready assistant.

Let me know if that works.

Thanks,
Prasanna

Let me know if you want to include a bullet like “aligns with IRB guardrails / candidate consent logic” or make it shorter.
