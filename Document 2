## 1. Objectives
- Reduce call center volume by automating responses to member inquiries about claim status, denial reasons, and reimbursement timelines.
- Improve the member experience with self-service options powered by natural language understanding.
- Demonstrate integration with simulated claims data to support a proof of concept tailored to the healthcare payer industry.

## 4. Flows Implemented

### Flow: Send_Verification_Code_Custom_Member
- Input: inputEmail (Text)
- Output: verificationCode, authenticationKey
- Sends email OTP

### Flow: Verify_Member_Code_Custom
- Inputs: authenticationKey, memberCode
- Outputs: isVerified (Boolean), messageAfterVerification (Text)

### Flow: Get_Claim_Status_Main
- Inputs: Claim_ID, Verified_Email
- Queries Claim__c based on both fields

### Flow: Member_Claims_List
- Input: Member_ID__c

---

## 6. Experience Cloud Deployment

### Site Setup:

- Ensured Omni-Channel routing and presence is active
- Updated profile permissions for site guest/user to access required objects

### Deployment Notes:
- Flows tested in Lightning runtime
